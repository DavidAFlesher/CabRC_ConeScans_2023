The output data is too large to be upload to github (104 MB), but it is the output of the Get_Phi_Scans_Cones_python.py script. Its format is similar to that seen in the computational_conescans/output_data/ directory, but with many more (B)Chls in the json file. This file is used as an input to the "analyze_cone_scans_multi_nofill_blacked.py" script which produces the figures.
