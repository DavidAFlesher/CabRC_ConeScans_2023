# CabRC_ConeScans_2023
Supplementary information on the cone scans performed in the manuscript "A quantitative assessment of (bacterio)chlorophyll assignments in the cryo-EM structure of the Chloracidobacterium thermophilum reaction center" (https://doi.org/10.1007/s11120-023-01047-5).

There is a decent amount of code debt here in terms of formatting, but with some edits and restructuring of directories, all data can be easily reproduced from these file. The file ConeScan_notes.txt will be helpful. Please feel free to email me at david.flesher@yale.edu if you have any questions.
